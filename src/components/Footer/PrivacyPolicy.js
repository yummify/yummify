      <h1>Yummify Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        At Yummify, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
        Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information
        in connection with our services. Please read this policy carefully to
        understand our practices.
      </p>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information that you provide to us directly, such as when you
        create an account, place an order, or contact our support team. This
        information may include your name, email address, phone number, and
        payment information.
      </p>
      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use your information to provide and improve our services, personalize
        your experience, and communicate with you. We may also use your
        information to comply with legal obligations or to protect our rights
        and interests.
      </p>
      <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We may share your information with third-party service providers who
        help us deliver our services, such as payment processors or logistics
        partners. We may also share your information with law enforcement or
        other parties if required by law or if we believe in good faith that
        such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or interests.
      </p>
      <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from
        unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use industry-standard
        security protocols and technologies to secure your data and prevent
        unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the
        internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee
        absolute security.
      </p>
      <h2>Updates to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our services or applicable laws and regulations. If we make material
        changes to this policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a
        notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective. We
        encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates or
        changes.
      </p>

        data practices, please contact us at privacy@yummify.com.
