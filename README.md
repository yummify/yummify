# Yummify

Yummify is a full stack e-commerce app that helps businesses and users by supporting them in reducing food waste and maximizing the value of their dollar.  This platform allows restaurants to offer discount “surprise bags,” at the hours of their choosing, so that their unsold or unused food goes to customers, rather than into the trash.  They reduce the amount of trash hauling they need, recoup some of the costs for purchasing ingredients and preparing the food, and demonstrate to their customers that they are taking responsibility for their environmental impact. 

## Features
